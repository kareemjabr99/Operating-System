# Operating-System
Mini Operating System Done On Java 

Hello Everyone.

This is a small operating system demonstrating how can 3 process run and how a scheduler give a time slice for each process to run.
Is uses mutaul exclusion to ensure the use of each reseource is done only by one process at a given time.

Thank you
